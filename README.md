# Crowdsourcerer: Data Collector
#### A Custom Integration for the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)

This integration was developed in the context of the final project for Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática (Bachelors in Informatics Engineering) at University of Aveiro. 
It collects the data generated by a Home Assistant installation, filters it to remove personal data and sends it to a data lake, where we collect data from a number of smart houses. This data will then be available for further use, such as academic research.

For the best experience, pair this with the respective Dashboard Card available at [CrowdSourcerer Lovelace Card](https://github.com/CrowdSorcerer/crowdsourcerer-card).

## How to Install via HACS

First, you need to have HACS installed in your Home Assistant environment. More information [available here](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites).

  8. Select "Crowdsourcerer"
  
  Now, to configure the data collector, select the types of sensors you wish to send data about. Keep in mind 'All' and 'None' override all other selections, and 'None' overrides 'All'!
  Finally, click Submit, and you're all done!
  You may change the configuration at any time by coming back to the integration screen and pressing 'Configure'

#### 2 - Add Integration to Home Assistant
  This proceeds as any other integration.
  1. Go to Configuration.
  2. Select "Devices & Services"
  3. Click "Add Integration"
  4. Search for "Crowdsourcerer" or "Data Collector"
  5. Select "Crowdsourcerer"
  
#### 3 - Configure initial install
  Here, you can select which sensor groups' data to send. You can also select either "All" to send all data or "None", and don't send any data.
Please keep in mind that the "None" and "All" options will override everything, with "None" taking precedence. (If both "All" and "None" options are selected, no data will be collected).
  
##### You're done! 
  You can always change the configuration by returning to the "Devices & Services" screen and pressing "Configure" on the Crowdsourcerer integration.
